# RideCom Flutter

A Flutter implementation of the RideCom motorcycle communication app, migrated from React Native.

## Overview

RideCom Flutter is a cross-platform mobile application built with Flutter that enables real-time communication between motorcycle riders. This is a migration from the original React Native implementation to provide better performance and a more consistent user experience across platforms.

## Features

### Current Features
- âœ… User Authentication (Login/Register)
- âœ… User Profile Management
- âœ… Modern Flutter UI with Material Design 3
- âœ… State Management with BLoC
- âœ… Secure Token Storage
- âœ… Clean Architecture Pattern

### Planned Features
- ðŸš§ Real-time Voice Communication (WebRTC)
- ðŸš§ Group Management
- ðŸš§ Location Sharing
- ðŸš§ Push Notifications
- ðŸš§ Background Audio Processing
- ðŸš§ Offline Capabilities

## Architecture

The project follows Clean Architecture principles with the following structure:

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/         # App configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ router/         # Navigation routing
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/       # Core services (HTTP, Storage)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ theme/          # App theming
â”œâ”€â”€ features/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/           # Authentication feature
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ datasources/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ repositories/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ presentation/
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ bloc/
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ screens/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ widgets/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ home/           # Home feature
â””â”€â”€ shared/
    â””â”€â”€ widgets/        # Reusable UI components
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (>=3.0.0)
- Dart SDK (>=3.0.0)
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Android SDK / Xcode (for mobile development)

### Installation

1. **Install Flutter**: Follow the [official Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

2. **Clone the repository** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd RideCom/RideCom.Flutter
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   # For development
   flutter run
   
   # For specific platform
   flutter run -d android
   flutter run -d ios
   flutter run -d web
   ```

## Configuration

### Backend Connection
Update the API base URL in `lib/core/config/app_config.dart`:

```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://your-backend-url:3000';
```

### TURN Server Configuration
Configure the TURN server settings for WebRTC in `lib/core/config/app_config.dart`:

```dart
static const String turnServerUrl = 'turn:your-turn-server:3478';
static const String turnServerUsername = 'your-username';
static const String turnServerCredential = 'your-password';
```

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Create feature directory under `lib/features/`
2. Follow the Clean Architecture pattern
3. Use BLoC for state management
4. Add necessary tests

### Code Style
- Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guidelines
- Use `flutter analyze` to check for issues
- Format code with `dart format`

## Migration Notes

This Flutter implementation aims to maintain feature parity with the original React Native version while providing:
- Better performance
- More consistent UI across platforms
- Easier maintenance and development
- Better tooling and debugging support

The migration follows a incremental approach, allowing both versions to coexist during the transition period.
