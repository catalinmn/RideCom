# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a motorcycle rider group communication mobile app that enables real-time voice communication between multiple riders during rides. The app will use React Native for cross-platform mobile development and NestJS for the backend signaling server, with WebRTC providing peer-to-peer audio communication over internet connections. The system must handle 4-8 riders simultaneously with automatic reconnection capabilities and battery optimization for long rides.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time Group Voice Communication

**User Story:** As a motorcycle rider, I want to communicate with multiple riders in my group simultaneously through voice, so that we can coordinate during rides without stopping or using hand signals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rider joins a communication room THEN the system SHALL establish WebRTC connections with all active participants
2. WHEN multiple riders speak simultaneously THEN the system SHALL mix and transmit all audio streams without cutting off speakers
3. WHEN a rider speaks THEN all other participants SHALL receive the audio within 200ms latency
4. WHEN 4-8 riders are in a group THEN the system SHALL maintain stable voice communication for all participants
5. IF network conditions degrade THEN the system SHALL adapt audio quality to maintain connection stability

### Requirement 2: Cross-Platform Mobile Application

**User Story:** As a motorcycle rider using either iOS or Android, I want the app to work consistently on my device, so that all group members can participate regardless of their phone choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is installed on iOS THEN it SHALL provide identical functionality to the Android version
2. WHEN the app requests audio permissions THEN it SHALL handle platform-specific permission flows correctly
3. WHEN the app runs on different screen sizes THEN the UI SHALL adapt responsively
4. WHEN platform-specific audio interruptions occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and resume communication

### Requirement 3: Automatic Reconnection

**User Story:** As a motorcycle rider experiencing intermittent connectivity, I want the app to automatically reconnect when my connection drops, so that I don't lose communication with my group during rides.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection within 5 seconds
2. WHEN reconnection attempts fail THEN the system SHALL use exponential backoff with maximum 30-second intervals
3. WHEN connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically rejoin the active communication session
4. WHEN reconnecting THEN other participants SHALL be notified of the rider's connection status
5. IF reconnection fails after 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide manual reconnect option

### Requirement 4: Background Operation

**User Story:** As a motorcycle rider, I want the app to continue working when my phone screen is off or when using navigation apps, so that communication remains active throughout the ride.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app moves to background THEN voice communication SHALL continue uninterrupted
2. WHEN the device screen locks THEN the app SHALL maintain WebRTC connections
3. WHEN other apps are opened THEN the communication app SHALL continue running in background
4. WHEN the system attempts to suspend the app THEN it SHALL request background execution permissions
5. IF background execution is denied THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide guidance

### Requirement 5: Battery Optimization

**User Story:** As a motorcycle rider on long rides, I want the app to minimize battery drain, so that my phone remains functional for navigation and emergency use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is running THEN CPU usage SHALL not exceed 15% on average
2. WHEN in active communication THEN memory usage SHALL not exceed 100MB
3. WHEN no one is speaking THEN the system SHALL reduce processing to conserve battery
4. WHEN network conditions are stable THEN the system SHALL optimize connection parameters for efficiency
5. IF battery level drops below 20% THEN the system SHALL offer power-saving mode options

### Requirement 6: Voice Activity Detection and Audio Processing

**User Story:** As a motorcycle rider, I want the app to automatically detect when I'm speaking and reduce background noise, so that communication is clear despite wind and engine noise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rider speaks THEN the system SHALL detect voice activity within 100ms
2. WHEN background noise is present THEN the system SHALL apply noise suppression algorithms
3. WHEN wind noise is detected THEN the system SHALL filter frequencies above 4kHz
4. WHEN engine noise is present THEN the system SHALL apply adaptive filtering
5. WHEN no voice activity is detected THEN the system SHALL not transmit audio data

### Requirement 7: User Authentication and Room Management

**User Story:** As a motorcycle rider, I want to create or join private communication rooms with my riding group, so that our conversations remain secure and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL create a secure account with encrypted credentials
2. WHEN a user creates a room THEN the system SHALL generate a unique room code
3. WHEN a user joins a room THEN the system SHALL verify the room code and user permissions
4. WHEN a room is created THEN the creator SHALL have administrative privileges
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt

### Requirement 8: Connection Quality Management

**User Story:** As a motorcycle rider with varying network conditions, I want the app to adapt to my connection quality, so that communication remains functional even with poor signal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL reduce audio bitrate automatically
2. WHEN packet loss exceeds 5% THEN the system SHALL implement error correction
3. WHEN RTT exceeds 500ms THEN the system SHALL notify users of connection issues
4. WHEN connection quality improves THEN the system SHALL automatically increase audio quality
5. IF connection becomes unusable THEN the system SHALL attempt to switch to backup TURN servers

### Requirement 9: Real-time Signaling Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a robust signaling server that coordinates WebRTC connections, so that riders can establish and maintain peer-to-peer communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clients request signaling THEN the NestJS server SHALL handle WebSocket connections
2. WHEN ICE candidates are exchanged THEN the server SHALL relay them between peers
3. WHEN session descriptions are negotiated THEN the server SHALL facilitate the exchange
4. WHEN connection state changes THEN the server SHALL update all participants
5. IF the signaling server fails THEN backup servers SHALL take over within 10 seconds

### Requirement 10: Data Persistence and Analytics

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to store user data and communication logs, so that I can monitor system performance and provide user support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users register THEN their profiles SHALL be stored in PostgreSQL
2. WHEN communication sessions occur THEN connection logs SHALL be recorded
3. WHEN system errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with full context
4. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be stored in Redis for real-time access
5. IF data retention limits are reached THEN old logs SHALL be archived or purged automatically
